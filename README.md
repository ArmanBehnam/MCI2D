# MCI Progression Analysis by GNN Explanation

## Overview

This repository contains code and analysis for studying Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) progression using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) explanation methods, with a focus on causal relationships and explainability.

We analyze MCI progression and reversion using temporal medical data through a novel approach combining GNNs with causal explanation methods. Our research focuses on identifying key factors influencing MCI transitions and understanding their causal relationships.

### 2. GNN Training
- Models: T-GCN, GAT, GraphSage
- Classification task: Predicting disease progression stages
- Training parameters:
  - K-fold cross-validation
  - Early stopping
  - Hyperparameter tuning via Optuna
  - AdamW optimizer
  - 200 epochs

### 3. GNN Explanation Methods
- CXGNN (Novel Causal Explainer)
- Guided Backpropagation (Guidedbp)
- GNNExplainer
- Integrated Gradients (IG)
- RCExplainer

### 4. MCI Progress and Reversion Analysis

- Glial fibrillary acidic protein biomarker (0.1422)

## Evaluation Metrics

- **Graph Explanation Stability (GES)**: Measures consistency of explanations across different graph structures
- **Graph Explanation Accuracy (GEA)**: Evaluates accuracy of the explanation method
- **Graph Explanation Faithfulness (GEF)**: Measures how faithful the explanation is to the model's decision process

## Limitations

- Sample size limitations (n=369)
- Generalizability concerns due to Midwestern population focus (MCSA cohort)
- Potential unmeasured confounders
- Need for external validation
